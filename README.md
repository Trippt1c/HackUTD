# HackUTD - Goldman Sachs Challenge - *Risk Analyzer*

Submitted by: **Dylan Trang, Kelly Pham, Clowie Garcia, Pooja Ganapathy**

Risk Analyzer helps calculate the risk percentage of an investment portfolio (uplaoded as a .csv file) using data from various APIs. 

## Features
- [X] **Calculates overall risk of portfolio and risk of each type of investment (stocks, bonds, etc.) in the portfolio**
- [X] **Displays pie chart showing the risks mentioned above**
- [X] **Calculates risk factor for each stock in the portfolio using data from APIs**
- [X] **Displays table showing the stocks in the portfolio and each stock's current value, gains and losses, stock history, and calculated risk factor**
- [X] **Displays current interest rate for the bonds and savings in the portfolio**

## Notes
Our team decided to work on this project after attending a workshop about implementing APIs at HackUTD. We built this project using Python and used libraries such as 
tkinter (for the GUI) and requests (for API integration). None of us have coded much in Python, so this was a learning experience for us. Some of the challenges we faced
included finding the factors that affect the risk of an investment, determining an algorithm to calculate the risk, and figuring out which APIs would be best to use and
which data to use from the APIs. We are proud of the fact that we have a functioning program after studying Python on our own, and that we learned how to create a GUI
and implement APIs in Python. While we couldn't implement every feature on the list, we have included them in our design for the project that we made using Figma.
